    "1.How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "copy() will copy a single file, shutil. copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it. Calling shutil. copytree( source, destination ) will copy the folder at the path source , along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination\n",

    "2.What function is used to rename files?\n",
    "The os. rename() method allows you to rename files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "The send2trash functions will move a file or folder to the recycle bin, while shutil functions will permanently delete files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is\n",
    "equivalent to File objects’ open() method?\n",
    "ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. By lossless compression, we mean that the compression algorithm allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. So, a ZIP file is a single file containing one or more compressed files, offering an ideal way to make large files smaller and keep related files together.\n",
