    "#What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "The only difference is that (a) the body of a lambda can consist of only a single expression, the result of which is returned from the function created and (b) a lambda expression is an expression which evaluates to a function object, while a def statement has no value, and creates a function object and binds it to a name\n",
    "#What is the benefit of lambda?\n",
    "One of the benefits of using lambda expression is the reduced amount of code. See the example below. In this case, we are not passing any parameter in lambda expression because the run() method of the functional interface (Runnable) takes no argument\n",
    "#Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "reduce() works differently than map() and filter() . It does not return a new list based on the function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value. ... The result returned by the function is used in another call to function alongside with the next (third in this case), element\n",
    "#What are function annotations, and how are they used?\n",
    "Function annotations provide a way of associating various parts of a function with arbitrary python expressions at compile time. The PEP-3107 makes no attempt to introduce any kind of standard semantics, even for the built-in types. All this work left to the third-party libraries\n",
    "#What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution. The process may repeat several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration\n",
    "#What are some general design guidelines for coding functions?\n",
    "Safe: It can be used without causing harm.\n",
    "Secure: It can't be hacked.\n",
    "Reliable: It functions as it should, every time.\n",
    "Testable: It can be tested at the code level.\n",
    "Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.\n",
    "Portable: It works the same in every environment.\n",
