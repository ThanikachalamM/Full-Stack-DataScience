    "#What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "What is the difference between a class and a module? Modules are collections of methods and constants. They cannot generate instances. Classes may generate instances (objects), and have per-instance state (instance variables).\n",
    "#How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",
    "#Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance. We define class attributes outside all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header\n",
    "#Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "Let's start with the basics: An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,..) of the class.\n",
    "#What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "#How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "To perform operator overloading, Python provides some special function or magic function that is automatically invoked when it is associated with that particular operator. For example, when we use + operator, the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined.\n",
    "#When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class\n",
    "#What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "A very popular and convenient example is the Addition (+) operator. Just think how the '+' operator operates on two numbers and the same operator operates on two strings. It performs “Addition” on numbers whereas it performs “Concatenation” on strings.\n",
    "#What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "we will elaborate on two key concepts of OOP which are inheritance and polymorphism. Both inheritance and polymorphism are key ingredients for designing robust, flexible, and easy-to-maintain software. These concepts are best explained via examples. Let's start with creating a simple class.\n"
